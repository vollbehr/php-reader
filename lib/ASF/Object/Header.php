/**
 * The role of the header object is to provide a well-known byte sequence at the
 * beginning of ASF files and to contain all the information that is needed to
 * properly interpret the information within the data object. The header object
 * can optionally contain metadata such as bibliographic information.
 *
 * Of the three top-level ASF objects, the header object is the only one that
 * contains other ASF objects. The header object may include a number of
 * standard objects including, but not limited to:
 *
 *  o File Properties Object -- Contains global file attributes.
 *  o Stream Properties Object -- Defines a digital media stream and its
 *    characteristics.
 *  o Header Extension Object -- Allows additional functionality to be added to
 *    an ASF file while maintaining backward compatibility.
 *  o Content Description Object -- Contains bibliographic information.
 *  o Script Command Object -- Contains commands that can be executed on the
 *    playback timeline.
 *  o Marker Object -- Provides named jump points within a file.
 *
 * Note that objects in the header object may appear in any order. To be valid,
 * the header object must contain a {@link ASF_Object_FileProperties File
 * Properties Object}, a {@link ASF_Object_HeaderExtension Header Extension
 * Object}, and at least one {@link ASF_Object_StreamProperties Stream
 * Properties Object}.
