/**
 * The <i>Script Command Object</i> provides a list of type/parameter pairs of
 * strings that are synchronized to the ASF file's timeline. Types can include
 * URL or FILENAME values. Other type values may also be freely defined and
 * used. The semantics and treatment of this set of types are defined by the
 * local implementations. The parameter value is specific to the type field. You
 * can use this type/parameter pairing for many purposes, including sending URLs
 * to be launched by a client into an HTML frame (in other words, the URL type)
 * or launching another ASF file for the chained continuous play of audio or
 * video presentations (in other words, the FILENAME type). This object is also
 * used as a method to stream text, as well as to provide script commands that
 * you can use to control elements within the client environment.
