/**
 * The <i>Stream Prioritization Object</i> indicates the author's intentions as
 * to which streams should or should not be dropped in response to varying
 * network congestion situations. There may be special cases where this
 * preferential order may be ignored (for example, the user hits the "mute"
 * button). Generally it is expected that implementations will try to honor the
 * author's preference.
 * 
 * The priority of each stream is indicated by how early in the list that
 * stream's stream number is listed (in other words, the list is ordered in
 * terms of decreasing priority).
 * 
 * The Mandatory flag field shall be set if the author wants that stream kept
 * "regardless". If this flag is not set, then that indicates that the stream
 * should be dropped in response to network congestion situations. Non-mandatory
 * streams must never be assigned a higher priority than mandatory streams.
