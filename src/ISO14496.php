/**
 * This class represents a file in ISO base media file format as described in
 * ISO/IEC 14496 Part 12 standard.
 *
 * The ISO Base Media File Format is designed to contain timed media information
 * for a presentation in a flexible, extensible format that facilitates
 * interchange, management, editing, and presentation of the media. This
 * presentation may be local to the system containing the presentation, or may
 * be via a network or other stream delivery mechanism.
 *
 * The file structure is object-oriented; a file can be decomposed into
 * constituent objects very simply, and the structure of the objects inferred
 * directly from their type. The file format is designed to be independent of
 * any particular network protocol while enabling efficient support for them in
 * general.
 *
 * The ISO Base Media File Format is a base format for media file formats.
