 * The first part of the ID3v2 tag is the 10 byte tag header. The first three
 * bytes of the tag are always "ID3", to indicate that this is an ID3v2 tag,
 * directly followed by the two version bytes. The first byte of ID3v2 version
 * is its major version, while the second byte is its revision number. All
 * revisions are backwards compatible while major versions are not. The version
 * is followed by the ID3v2 flags field, of which currently four flags are used.
