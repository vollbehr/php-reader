/**
 * The <i>Attached picture</i> frame contains a picture directly related to the
 * audio file. Image format is the MIME type and subtype for the image.
 *
 * There may be several pictures attached to one file, each in their individual
 * APIC frame, but only one with the same content descriptor. There may only
 * be one picture with the same picture type. There is the possibility to put
 * only a link to the image file by using the MIME type "-->" and having a
 * complete URL instead of picture data.
 *
 * The use of linked files should however be used sparingly since there is the
 * risk of separation of files.
