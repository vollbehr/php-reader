/**
 * The <i>Group identification registration</i> frame enables grouping of
 * otherwise unrelated frames. This can be used when some frames are to be
 * signed. To identify which frames belongs to a set of frames a group
 * identifier must be registered in the tag with this frame.
 *
 * The owner identifier is a URL containing an email address, or a link to a
 * location where an email address can be found, that belongs to the
 * organisation responsible for this grouping. Questions regarding the grouping
 * should be sent to the indicated email address.
 *
 * The group symbol contains a value that associates the frame with this group
 * throughout the whole tag, in the range $80-F0. All other values are reserved.
 * The group symbol may optionally be followed by some group specific data, e.g.
 * a digital signature. There may be several "GRID" frames in a tag but only one
 * containing the same symbol and only one containing the same owner identifier.
 * The group symbol must be used somewhere in the tag. See
 * {@link ID3_Frame#GROUPING_IDENTITY} for more information.
