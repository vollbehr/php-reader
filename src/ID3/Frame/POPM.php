/**
 * The purpose of the <i>Popularimeter</i> frame is to specify how good an audio
 * file is. Many interesting applications could be found to this frame such as a
 * playlist that features better audio files more often than others or it could
 * be used to profile a person's taste and find other good files by comparing
 * people's profiles. The frame contains the email address to the user, one
 * rating byte and a four byte play counter, intended to be increased with one
 * for every time the file is played.
 *
 * The rating is 1-255 where 1 is worst and 255 is best. 0 is unknown. If no
 * personal counter is wanted it may be omitted. When the counter reaches all
 * one's, one byte is inserted in front of the counter thus making the counter
 * eight bits bigger in the same away as the play counter
 * {@link ID3_Frame_PCNT}. There may be more than one POPM frame in each tag,
 * but only one with the same email address.
