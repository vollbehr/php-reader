/**
 * The <i>Relative volume adjustment (2)</i> frame is a more subjective frame than
 * the previous ones. It allows the user to say how much he wants to
 * increase/decrease the volume on each channel when the file is played. The
 * purpose is to be able to align all files to a reference volume, so that you
 * don't have to change the volume constantly. This frame may also be used to
 * balance adjust the audio. The volume adjustment is encoded as a fixed point
 * decibel value, 16 bit signed integer representing (adjustment*512), giving
 * +/- 64 dB with a precision of 0.001953125 dB. E.g. +2 dB is stored as $04 00
 * and -2 dB is $FC 00.
 *
 * There may be more than one RVA2 frame in each tag, but only one with the same
 * identification string.
