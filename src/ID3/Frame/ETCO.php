/**
 * The <i>Event timing codes</i> allows synchronisation with key events in the
 * audio.
 *
 * The events are an array of timestamp and type pairs. The time stamp is set to
 * zero if directly at the beginning of the sound or after the previous event.
 * All events are sorted in chronological order.
 *
 * The events $E0-EF are for user events. You might want to synchronise your
 * music to something, like setting off an explosion on-stage, activating a
 * screensaver etc.
 *
 * There may only be one ETCO frame in each tag.
