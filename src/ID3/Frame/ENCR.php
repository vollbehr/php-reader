 * To identify with which method a frame has been encrypted the encryption
 * method must be registered in the tag with the <i>Encryption method
 * registration</i> frame.
 *
 * The owner identifier a URL containing an email address, or a link to a
 * location where an email address can be found, that belongs to the
 * organisation responsible for this specific encryption method. Questions
 * regarding the encryption method should be sent to the indicated email
 * address.
 *
 * The method symbol contains a value that is associated with this method
 * throughout the whole tag, in the range $80-F0. All other values are reserved.
 * The method symbol may optionally be followed by encryption specific data.
 *
 * There may be several ENCR frames in a tag but only one containing the same
 * symbol and only one containing the same owner identifier. The method must be
 * used somewhere in the tag. See {@link ID3_Frame#ENCRYPTION} for more
 * information.
