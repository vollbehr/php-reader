   *
   * p - Tag size restrictions
   *
   *   00   No more than 128 frames and 1 MB total tag size.
   *   01   No more than 64 frames and 128 KB total tag size.
   *   10   No more than 32 frames and 40 KB total tag size.
   *   11   No more than 32 frames and 4 KB total tag size.
   *
   * q - Text encoding restrictions
   *
   *   0    No restrictions
   *   1    Strings are only encoded with ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8.
   *
   * r - Text fields size restrictions
   *
   *   00   No restrictions
   *   01   No string is longer than 1024 characters.
   *   10   No string is longer than 128 characters.
   *   11   No string is longer than 30 characters.
   *
   *   Note that nothing is said about how many bytes is used to represent those
   *   characters, since it is encoding dependent. If a text frame consists of
   *   more than one string, the sum of the strungs is restricted as stated.
   *
   * s - Image encoding restrictions
   *
   *   0   No restrictions
   *   1   Images are encoded only with PNG [PNG] or JPEG [JFIF].
   *
   * t - Image size restrictions
   *
   *   00  No restrictions
   *   01  All images are 256x256 pixels or smaller.
   *   10  All images are 64x64 pixels or smaller.
